## Project Pitch
The goal of our project is to build a robot that can traverse and map subterranean environments. The robot will be able to traverse rough terrain, use LIDAR to avoid obstacles, and generate a 3D mapping of its environment. This project is largely inspired by DARPAâ€™s subterranean challenge.
